# randomPasswordGenerator-Java
 Creates several strong passwords using Java.

 --How to Use It--
 This program is currently development, so you can only run it in debug mode on your editor. I prefer to use VSCode.

 --Upcoming release functionality--
 Also saves selected passwords into a MySQL database, from which the user can readily scan and call data.
